# Ca<sub>V</sub>β is a molecular switch controlling the endocytic turnover and trafficking dynamics of L-type calcium channels

Datasets accompanying *Ca<sub>V</sub>β is a molecular switch controlling the endocytic turnover and trafficking dynamics of L-type calcium channels* by Conrad et al.

## Datasets
* [Figure2_3](../master/Figure2_3) Trajectories and analysis from single-particle tracking experiments shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Files containig "hek293" in folders [CaV12-mNG](../master/Figure2_3/CaV12mNG) and [CaVb2a](../master/Figure2_3/CaVb2a) are from coexpression experiments where Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-mNG and Ca<sub>V</sub>β were transiently cotransfected. Files in folder [CaV12-b2a](../master/Figure2_3/CaV12-b2a) are also from experiments in HEK239 cells expressing the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2mNG-Ca<sub>V</sub>β concatemer.
Files containig "flp" are from experiments with an Ca<sub>V</sub>β inducible Flp-In T-REx cell line either transfected with [CaV12-Halo](../master/Figure2_3/CaV12Halo) or [CaV12-mNG](../master/Figure2_3/CaV12mNG). The corresponding induced Ca<sub>V</sub>β can be found in folder [CaVb_Halo](../master/Figure2_3/CaVb2a_Halo).  
* [Figure4](../master/Figure4) Data of flourescence intensity of external fluorescently labelled Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-HA or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-HA-Ca<sub>V</sub>β in the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells (and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-HA-Ca<sub>V</sub>β in HL-1 cells). The decay of the fluorescence intensity was used to calculate time constants of internalization.
