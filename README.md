# CaVβ is a molecular switch controlling the endocytic turnover and trafficking dynamics of L-type calcium channels

Datasets accompanying *CaVβ is a molecular switch controlling the endocytic turnover and trafficking dynamics of L-type calcium channels* by Conrad et al.

## Datasets
* [Figure2_3](../master/Figure2_3) Trajectories and analysis from single-particle tracking experiments shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Files containig "hek293" in folders [CaV12-mNG](../master/Figure2_3/CaV12mNG) and [CaVb2a](../master/Figure2_3/CaVb2a) are from coexpression experiments where CaV1.2-mNG and CaVb were transiently cotransfected. Files in folder [CaV12-b2a](../master/Figure2_3/CaV12-b2a) are also from experiments in HEK239 cells expressing the CaV1.2mNG-CaVb concatemer.
Files containig "flp" are from experiments with a stable CaVb inducible (in folder [CaVb_Halo](../master/Figure2_3/CaVb2a_Halo) )  Flp-In T-REx cell line either transfected with [CaV12-Halo](../master/Figure2_3/CaV12Halo) or CaV12-mNG    
* [Figure4](../master/Figure4) Data of flourescence intensity of external fluorescently labelled CaV1.2-HA or CaV1.2-HA-CaVb in the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells (and CaV1.2-HA-CaVb in HL-1 cells). The decay of the fluorescence intensity was used to calculate time constants of internalization.
