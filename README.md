Datasets accompanying *CaVβ is a molecular switch controlling the endocytic turnover and trafficking dynamics of L-type calcium channels* by Conrad et al.

## data
* [Figure2_3](../master/data/Figure2_3) Trajectories and analysis from particle tracking experiments shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Files containig "hek293" in folders [CaV12mNG](../master/data/CaV12mNG) and [CaVb2a](../master/data/CaVb2a) are from coexpression experiments where CaV12mNG and CaVb2a were both transiently transfected. Files in folder [CaV12-b2a](../master/data/CaV12-b2a) are also from experiments in HEK239 cells expressing the CaV12mNG-CaVb2a concatemer.
Files containig "flp" are from experiments with stable [CaV12Halo](../master/data/CaV12Halo) or CaV12mNG cell lines transiently transfected with CaVb2a (in folder [CaVb2a_Halo](../master/data/CaVb2a_Halo) )    
* [Figure4](../master/data/Figure4) Flourescence data used to calculate time constants of internalisation
